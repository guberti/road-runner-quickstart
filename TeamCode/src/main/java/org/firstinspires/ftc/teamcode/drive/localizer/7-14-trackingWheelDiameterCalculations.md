Robot tracking wheel diameter tests:

We rolled the robot down a straight path and measured how far each encoder went

Trial 1:
Start:
PTOLeft 46, PTORight -28, driveLeft 48, robot at 0 in
End: 
PTOLeft -39856, PTORight 40027, driveLeft -158, robot at 120 in
Difference: 39902, 40055
PTOLeft 
Trial 2:
Start:
PTOLeft 0, PTORight 0, driveLeft 0, robot at 0 in
End: 
PTOLeft -39813, PTORight 40057, driveLeft -554, robot at 120 in
Difference: 39813, 40057
Trial 3:
Start:
PTOLeft 0, PTORight 0, driveLeft 0, robot at 0 in
End: 
PTOLeft -39799, PTORight 40061, driveLeft -317, robot at 120 in
Difference: -39799, 40061

Note - each trial we think we moved like 117.3 in
